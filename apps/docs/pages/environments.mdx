# Environments

Environments in A/BBY allow you to reflect the different environments that your application may be deployed to.
For example, you may have a `development` environment, a `staging` environment, and a `production` environment.

When using [Feature Flags](/feature-flags) it is often useful to have different values for the same flag in different environments.

When you create a new Environment all Flags will get a default value of `false` for that environment.
